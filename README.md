## Analysis
Without the categorical imperative that allows people to ethically steal, As the 
percentage of thieves goes up, the average wealth per year for thieves goes down.
This is because as thieves increase, there are less citizens to steal from and the
risk of getting robbed yourself goes up. So as more thieves pop up, there is less
utility to being a thief because there are less resouces to go around. I think if
the categorical imperative is disabled and thieves risk being punished, thieves would
still choose to steal from others because in the Social Contract Theory, rational 
people will agree to not steal from each other, but not everyone in large societies
is rational. Some people will choose to steal despite the social contract binding
them to not steal.
